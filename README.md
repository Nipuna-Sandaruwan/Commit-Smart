Best Practices
‚úÖ Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add" instead of "added").
‚úÖ Keep your messages concise but informative .
‚úÖ Include a body if additional explanation is needed.
‚úÖ Use the scope (in parentheses) to specify the affected part of the project.

By following semantic commit messages, you‚Äôll maintain a clean and understandable Git history, making collaboration and project management much smoother. üöÄ

Troubleshooting Tip
If you ever face this error after pushing to master or any other branch which is not main:

"There isn‚Äôt anything to compare. main and master are entirely different commit histories."
